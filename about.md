### John 'Zoator' Watson
One of the grand-daddies of modern day Tower Defense games through his ZoatorTD WarCraft III maps, he has decided the world is finally ready for his visions of game mechanics unfettered by proprietary map editors.

### Keerthik 'kOrc' Omanakuttan
Few things are longer than his name, besides the length of his relationship with gaming. Keerthik made his first pencil-n-paper game at the age of 7 which had a whopping 15 MAU for nearly a year and never ceased to design and build games. After having worked on fitness and motion games on the mobile platform, he's finally returning to his roots making cut-throat PC games with John.

Together we are ZoakO Studios.
