Color Balls is a high-speed anti-gravity racing game with a colorful twist. Set in a vibrant abstract universe, the colors of your ball and the world determine how fast (or slow) you get to go. Modify the track with bright colors as you zip through tunnels planning the perfect route for your next lap.

As Zoako Studios first official title, Color Balls embodies what we as a studio want to see in a game: Simple but innovative mechanics that stretch your creativity. Each tunnel starts out with very simple features, and some pools of paint you can pick up and mix. Once you have picked up paint you quickly change the traits of the tunnel creating a variety of colorful paths. In your next pass-through, an ideal path can quickly turn into a death trap if you didn't plan well enough or make a wrong turn.
