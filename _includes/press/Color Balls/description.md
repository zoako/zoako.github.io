Color Balls is a high stakes anti-grav racing game with a deeply incorporated puzzle/strategy element. You play as a marble rolling in an enclosed looping tunnel, trying to achieve the fastest possible time to complete set laps. The way to get fast enough to land a medal is to modify the tunnel itself, by covering it in paint that boosts you in subsequent laps.

As Zoako Studios first official title, Color Balls embodies what we as a studio want to see in a game: Simple but innovative mechanics that stretch your creativity. Each tunnel starts out with very simple features, and some pools of paint you can pick up and mix. Once you have picked up paint you quickly change the traits of the tunnel creating a variety of colorful paths. In your next pass-through, an ideal path can quickly turn into a death trap if you didn't plan well enough or make a wrong turn.
